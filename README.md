# dimensionality-reduction-ml
This project uses PCA and t-SNE to reduce high-dimensional datasets into fewer dimensions while preserving clusters and class separability. It then tests K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on reduced data to assess classification accuracy and examine tradeoffs between interpretability, visualization, and predictive power.
